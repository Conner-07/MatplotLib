The purpose of this assignment is to help visualize(for the sake of analyzing) 2 different datasets. 
The iris dataset is loaded for the purpose of exploring flower spcecies with various characteristics. 
Several different plots are utilized to do this such as scatter, box, and pair. 


From looking at the different graph types, one inference that can be made is that Setosa stands out from the other species.
due to its shorter petal length and width. Overall, it appears that the best characteristic to distinguish between the species are petal dimensions.
